    "    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Thanks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we\n",
    "    provide. You may not import anything else, you should be able to complete\n",
    "    the assignment with the given libraries (and in most cases without them).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into classes,\n",
