      "    but the functions should NOT save the image to file. (This is a problem\n",
      "    for us when grading because running 200 files results a lot of images being\n",
      "    saved to file and opened in dialogs, which is not ideal). Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "    2. DO NOT import any other libraries aside from the three libraries that we\n",

      "    3. DO NOT change the format of this file. Do not put functions into classes,\n",
